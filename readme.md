### 👋 Hi there! I'm Bella  
Originally from Poland, I now call Stockholm, Sweden my home since 2012. My coding journey began in early 2022, starting with web development and evolving into iOS development.

#### 🌐 Coding Journey & Current Focus
- **Languages & Technologies**: Began with Python, C#, and PHP, developing web projects like [Johnies Restaurant](https://github.com/izabela-marcinkowska/Restaurant-Project) and [Omnifood](https://github.com/izabela-marcinkowska/Omnifood-Project).
- **Notable Projects**: 
  - **[DigestEase](https://github.com/izabela-marcinkowska/digestEase)**: An app to help users track their food intake with IBS considerations.
  - **[Deskify](https://github.com/Purrgrammers/deskify)**: Bootcamp project offering an interactive map for office managers to create, edit, and manage office layouts.
- **Current Focus**: Learning **Swift** and **SwiftUI** for iOS development through the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course.

#### 💼 Professional Goals
- **Mastering iOS Development**: Aiming to build functional, well-designed apps with Swift and SwiftUI.
- **Open to Collaboration**: Eager to work on mobile app projects and deepen my knowledge of app architecture, design patterns, and user experience.

#### 🌟 Beyond Code:
- 🎨 Documenting my coding adventures on [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@bugs_and_lemons) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bugs_and_lemons/)
- 🧩 Outside of coding, you’ll find me building LEGO, exploring new places, or enjoying time with my [boyfriend](https://johnie.se).
