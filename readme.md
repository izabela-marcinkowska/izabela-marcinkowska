### 👋 Hi there! I'm Bella  
Originally from Poland, I now call Stockholm, Sweden my home since 2012. My coding journey began in early 2022 and quickly expanded beyond web development into the exciting world of mobile app development, specifically focusing on iOS.

#### 🌐 Coding Journey & Current Focus
- **Languages & Technologies**: Starting with Python, C#, and PHP, I initially worked on web development projects like [Johnies Restaurant](https://github.com/izabela-marcinkowska/Restaurant-Project) and [Omnifood](https://github.com/izabela-marcinkowska/Omnifood-Project).
- **Notable Projects**: One of my key projects is **[DigestEase](https://github.com/izabela-marcinkowska/digestEase)**, an app designed to help users track their food intake with consideration for IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome). It's focused on helping users manage their diet based on their digestive health needs.
- **Current Focus**: Recently, I’ve shifted my focus to learning **Swift** and **SwiftUI** for iOS development, applying my knowledge to create intuitive and functional mobile apps.

#### 💼 Professional Goals
- **Current Focus**: Mastering **iOS development** with Swift and SwiftUI, with a goal of building functional, well-designed apps.
- **Looking Forward**: Always eager to collaborate on mobile app projects and expand my knowledge in app architecture, design patterns, and user experience in the context of iOS.

#### 🏅 Badges & Achievements
Here are some of the recognitions and badges I've earned along my coding journey:

#### Beyond Code:
- 🎨 A keen eye for design, often exploring the intersection of technology and art.
- 📖 When not coding, I'm likely immersed in a book, building Lego or traveling with my [boyfriend](https://johnie.se)
