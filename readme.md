### 👋 Hi there! I'm Bella
Originally from Poland, I now call Stockholm, Sweden my home since 2012. My coding journey began in early 2022 and it quickly blossomed into a passion for web development and beyond.

#### 🌐 Web Development & Coding Journey
- **Languages & Technologies**: After starting with Python, C# and PHP I decided to focus on Web development working on small CSS and HTML projects as [Johnies Restaurant](https://github.com/izabela-marcinkowska/Restaurant-Project) and [Omnifood](https://github.com/izabela-marcinkowska/Omnifood-Project)
- **Education**: A graduate of [SALT](https://github.com/saltsthlm) - an intense 13-week program where I was among the top 5% of applicants. Here, I honed both front-end and back-end development skills, specifically in CSS, HTML, TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, React, Redux, Express and more.
- **Working Style**: Experienced in mob programming, adapting to group work, and employing Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodologies.

#### 💼 Professional Goals
- **Current Focus**: Developing a robust [Password Generator](https://github.com/izabela-marcinkowska/password-generator).
- **Looking Forward**: Eager to meet new people in the field, collaborate on innovative projects, and continuously enhance my coding skills.

#### 🏅 Badges & Achievements
Here are some of the recognitions and badges I've earned along my coding journey:

#### Beyond Code:
- 🎨 A keen eye for design, often exploring the intersection of technology and art.
- 📖 When not coding, I'm likely immersed in a book, building Lego or traveling with my [boyfriend](https://johnie.se)
